        <h1>Why Choose Vegan?</h1>

            <p> You've seen it online, you've seen it on products in the grocery store, and you've even seen it on non-edible items like makeup and clothing.
				It might show up as just a "V" or the entire word "vegan" in small print at the bottom of the label, or it could be listed in the product description on the website.
				But what <i>exactly</i> is "vegan?" What <i>exactly</i> is veganism, and why are people so adamant about it? In this post, I want to answer these questions and 
				help you understand what veganism is and why it is important to consider, especially in the wake of an increase in climate change and in contagious zoonotic diseases.
				<br>First thing's first, what is veganism? The Vegan Society has an official definition of veganism, which is this:
				<br><br><i>"Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for 
				food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. 
				In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals."</i>
				<br><br>Now, that is quite the mouthful, so let me break it down for you. The first part talks about removing the use of animals and their products "as far as is possible and practicable."
				That means that, for example, if you are at the grocery store looking to get some milk, you would choose the non-dairy option. Same with cheese, meat, snacks, etc. This extends not 
				only to food, but also to clothing and makeup as well. Now if you were in the Arctic or the Sahara Desert and your only option for food was an animal, of course no one would
				 expect you to just run to a grocery store and choose a non-animal option because there literally isn't one. That's why it's "as far as is possible and practicable" not "exclude all no matter what."
				 <br>The second part of the definition talks about promoting animal-free alternatives in the place of the animal-full products to benefit us, the animals, and ultimately the planet;
				 but you might be wondering, "why should I go vegan?" or perhaps, "what benefit is there for abstaining from animal products?" There are three main points for why people should be vegan: 
				 <br><br>The first point, and probably most obvious, is it's most beneficial for the animals if people were vegan. The steak on your plate wasn't grown in a lab (yet!), it came from a living being,
				 someone that did not want to die. Animals do think differently than humans, that much is obvious; but the way they experience fear, pain, and suffering are all the same as dogs, cats, birds, 
				 and us humans. You don't have to believe that animals are on the same level as us (I don't!), but their lives are more important than our tastebuds. 
				 <br><br>The second point is it's actually beneficial for human health. There are thousands of studies on plant-based diets and their effects versus the standard American diet, 
				 and these studies show the negative effects of having animal protein and fat in our diet (increasing IGF-1 hormones, leeching calcium from our bones, increasing fatty liver disease and heart 
				 disease, etc), and show the positive effects of plant-based diets lowering and even reversing diseases like type 2 diabetes, obesity, heart disease, fatty liver disease, and much more. 
				 There is also something to say about the amount of viruses and diseases that have come from the increase in animal farming and domestication. The AIDS virus came from an African bush meat trade where they 
				 sold chopped up primates. Mad cow disease came from adding meat to the cow feed. The 2009 Swine flu outbreak was not from some Asian live animal market like the COVID-19 virus, but from industrial pig factory 
				 farms right here in the US. <a href="https://www.nutritionfacts.org">Nutritionfacts.org </a>is an advertisement-free, non-profit website that brings the latest research in nutrition to the public eye, 
				 so if you are interested in doing research on studies like this and don't know where to start, I suggest to check them out!
				 <br><br>The third and final point is it's beneficial to the environment to be vegan. While there isn't as much conclusive research on this topic, it is obvious that the world is changing, 
				 and not for the better. Almost 75% of the US's arable farmland is used for animals. Vast tracts of land in the Amazon rainforest are cleared every day, for soybean production not for humans, but for 
				 animal feed. Animal agriculture is growing at an insane rate, and seeing as how 99% of the US's animal products come from factory farms, it is no surprise. If we weren't feeding all of these animals 
				 for slaughter, we could free up at least 50% of the crops grown in the US for human consumption. If all of the farms that produce food for animals used the food to feed humans, we could feed 
				 <i>10 BILLION people every year with ease.</i> Of course, stopping factory farming won't happen overnight. The animals won't be released all at once; but the farms will lower how many animals 
				 they breed for consumption to meet the decreasing demand until they either switch to a different form of production, become an animal sanctuary, or shut down entirely. 
				 <br><br>To sum it all up, being vegan is beneficial for our lives, including the well-being of the animals and the planet as a whole. If you are interested in learning more, there are several documentaries 
				 about what factory farming really looks like and how animal products affect our health. There are also a bunch of resources online that talk about veganism in greater detail, as well. This post is not 
				 here to convince you to be vegan, or force you to be vegan, but to give you an idea as to why vegans are actually vegan.</p>
