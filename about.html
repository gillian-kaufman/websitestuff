				Hi everyone!<br/>
				I'm Gillian the happy vegan bunny, and you have found yourself on my recipe blog! 
				Here, you'll find a bunch of my favorite vegan recipes, tips for starting (and staying on) a vegan lifestyle, and some tricks for making your food taste delicious!
				Stay tuned if you like good food!
                <br><br>I chose to follow a vegan lifestyle in September 2020 ultimately because I do not believe we have to cause horrible pain and suffering to someone
                just to have something to eat when there is a variety of plants that we can consume for maximum nutrition. I believe that animals are not on the same level 
                as us humans, but they deserve the right to live just as much as dogs, cats, hamsters, and us humans do. They deserve to live out their natural lives 
                without negative interference. If I told you that my health was not a concern of mine, I'd be lying to you. I have a family history of several cancers, lung 
                issues, heart issues, type 2 diabetes, and obesity; I also personally have asthma and am obese (according to BMI), and after doing a ton of research in nutrition and 
                trying pretty much everything else aside from surgery, I have nothing to lose. I am on this journey to help the animals, the planet, and anyone else willing to listen.
