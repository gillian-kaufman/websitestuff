				<h3><a href="CSS/BlogPosts/blogpost1.html">Why Choose Vegan?</a></h3>
				<br>
				<p> You've seen it online, you've seen it on products in the grocery store, and you've even seen it on non-edible items like makeup and clothing.
					It might show up as just a "V" or the entire word "vegan" in small print at the bottom of the label, or it could be listed in the product description on the website.
					But what <i>exactly</i> is "vegan?" What <i>exactly</i> is veganism, and why are people so adamant about it? In this post, I want to answer these questions and 
					help you understand what veganism is and why it is important to consider, especially in the wake of an increase in climate change and in contagious zoonotic diseases.
